The process consists of 2 parts:
- Missiles
- Effects

Missiles: missiles are kinda like projectiles
Effects: effects are like AoE's (these can sometimes be created with projectiles)

# Missiles

There is a dynamic array that keeps track of every missile that is currently present. 
This array contains missile(?) structs that might not contain every detail of the missile.
Missiles(?) get added to the array in the following function:
`0x0F1A1C0`
